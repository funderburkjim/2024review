The base form, xxx.txt,  of each dictionary xxx is in csl-orig repo.

This base form is converted to an xml form xxx.xml by csl-pywork scripts.

xxx.xml is valid relative to a dtd (document type definition) xxx.dtd
In fact, xxx.dtd = one.dtd  (same dtd for all dictionaries)

---------------------------------------------------------

xxx.txt is a mixture of xml markup and non-xml markup.
Some markup statistics for the xml markup in xxx.txt:

NOTE : Some 'new' dictionaries not included
NOTE : Some non-xml markup in xxx.txt is converted to xml markup in xxx.xml
       This done in make_xml.py (by code in csl-pywork repo)
  example 1: k1 of metaline converted to <key1>
  example 2: {#deva#} -> <s>deva</s>


dictionaries with an <ls> tag:
 tooltips: ap90 ben bhs gra# mw pw pwg sch
 no tooltips: bor md lan 
 # gra: the RV tooltips special markup (not ls) {661,10}
