        "body": "OK. The 'mfn' was missing in current database; now corrected.\n\nInterestingly, it was possible to catch within the historical update logs for MW the exact date that the mfn was dropped, 20080512.\n\nA comparison was made between a 2007 version (MONIERhBU.txt) and current monier.xml, looking for similar cases.  A few errors surfaced and were corrected; the exact context of this kind of error is difficult to track.\n\nThe google group is closed to non-members; its name 'Общество ревнителей санскрита' yields via google.translate the odd English phrase 'Society zealots Sanskrit'.\n",
